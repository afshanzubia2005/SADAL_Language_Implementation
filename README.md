# SADAL_Language_Implementation

## This project is for my CS280 Class: Programming Language Concepts! 

In this **SADAL Language Implementation**, I implemented the full pipeline in C++ for the fictional SADAL programming language, including a lexical analyzer, parser, and interpreter. This project was built across three separate stages to tokenize input, construct syntax trees, and interpret code written in SADAL.

**PA1**: SADAL Lexical Analyzer source code, header files, and tests.

**PA2**: SADAL Parser source code, header files, and tests.

**PA3:** SADAL Interpreter source code, header files, and tests.
